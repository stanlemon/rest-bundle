* 0.10.0 (2020-07-04)
 * Updated willdurand/negotiation, this involves a breaking change where version support no longer works by adding 'version=X' as a parameter in the Accept header. Instead you need to use the Accept-version header.

* 0.9.0 (2020-06-18)
 * Update dependencies across the board.
 * Drop support for Doctrine's Mongo ORM layer.

* 0.8.0 (2015-04-07)
 * Improved compatibility with older versions of symfony and doctrine. LemonRestBundle should work with Doctrine ORM 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 and with Symfony 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and preliminary support has passed for 2.7.
 * Refactoring direct usages of ORM classes in favor of \Doctrine\Common\Persistence classes, this opened the door up for supporting additional implementations of Doctrine then just the ORM.
 * Added support for changing which Doctrine registry is used.
 * Added support for Doctrine MongoDB ODM, and it works! All of the usual tests pass using mongo.
 * Fixed collections of id's for relationships, now instead of posting full object's the serializer can take a primary key and load the full object in its place for the relationship.
 * Fixed multiple depth object trees that previously broke after two levels.
 * Added support for posting relationships of existing objects.

* 0.7.0 (2015-02-28)
 * BC Default to plural resource names, this means if you didn't explicit name your object your endpoints will change. For example /api/post -> /api/posts, you can override this behavior by manually configuring the name on the object.
 * BC Added a first class definition object, which is used by the object registry. The object registry methods changed during this refactor. This definition class will allow for better storage of configuration than the simple arrays that were originally being passed around.
 * Added the option to map a directory of entities. This allows for you to use LemonRestBundle with a non-automapped directory of Doctrine entities.
 * Added the option to configure method types for an object, in other words you can now enable 'post' for an object and disable 'delete'. There are attributes on the annotation to support this, and it can be handled manually when working directly with the object registry.
 * Added support for posting an id to a relation to load the mapped relation, in other words a comment can be posted with a numerical value for property post and this will become the appropriate Post instance.
